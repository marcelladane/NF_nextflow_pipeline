# Solution Architecture

## Overview

This architecture implements a production-ready bioinformatics pipeline for AMR analysis using modern cloud-native and HPC technologies. The design prioritizes automation, scalability, and reliability for processing both Illumina and Nanopore sequencing data in a surveillance context.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Data Ingestion Layer

**Input Sources:**
- Illumina paired-end FASTQ files (R1/R2)
- Nanopore long-read FASTQ files

**Storage & Transfer:**
- **S3 Input Bucket** serves as landing zone for raw sequencing data
- **Automated upload** via rsync/DataSync with inotify for real-time file detection
- **Scheduled processing** triggered by S3 events at 2AM daily
- **Lambda trigger function** generates Nextflow samplesheets and initiates pipeline execution

### 2. Processing Infrastructure

**Compute Environment:**
- **SLURM cluster** provides scalable HPC resources for computationally intensive tasks
- **Nextflow workflow manager** orchestrates tool execution with automatic resource allocation
- **Containerized pipeline** using tools from AWS ECR:
  - Quality control: FastQC, NanoPlot, MultiQC
  - Assembly: SPAdes (Illumina), Flye (Nanopore)
  - AMR analysis: Abricate for comprehensive resistance gene detection
  - Quality assessment: QUAST for assembly metrics

**Pipeline Logic:**
- **Automatic platform detection** routes samples to appropriate tool chains
- **Resource optimization** with different CPU/memory profiles for local vs cloud execution
- **Error handling** and retry mechanisms built into Nextflow processes

### 3. Quality Assurance & Data Validation

**Completion Detection:**
- **SLURM hooks** provide reliable pipeline completion signals
- **SNS topic orchestration** coordinates post-processing validation steps

**Multi-Step Validation Process:**
1. **Database insertion validation** - confirms results successfully stored
2. **File integrity checking** - validates output file completeness and checksums
3. **Cleanup coordination** - only proceeds after all validations pass

**Benefits:**
- Prevents data loss from incomplete processing
- Ensures database consistency
- Provides audit trail for troubleshooting

### 4. Data Storage & Lakehouse Architecture

**Results Database:**
- **SQL/Parquet format** enables both analytical queries and data science workflows
- **Structured schema** for AMR results, assembly metrics, and sample metadata
- **Optimized for surveillance queries** (resistance trends, outbreak detection)

**Long-term Storage:**
- **S3 storage buckets** organized by date and sample identifiers
- **Automated archival** triggered only after successful validation
- **Lifecycle policies** for cost-effective data retention

### 5. API Layer & Data Access

**FastAPI Implementation:**
- **RESTful endpoints** for programmatic access to results
- **Standardized response formats** for downstream application integration
- **Query capabilities** for filtering by resistance genes, sample dates, or analysis metrics
- **Authentication and rate limiting** for secure access control

### 6. DevOps & Operational Excellence

**CI/CD Pipeline:**
- **GitHub/GitLab integration** with automated testing and deployment
- **Container security scanning** before ECR deployment
- **Staged deployments** with validation gates
- **Infrastructure as Code** for reproducible deployments

**Monitoring & Observability:**
- **CloudWatch integration** for pipeline metrics and alerting
- **Custom dashboards** for surveillance team monitoring
- **Error tracking** and automated notification systems
- **Performance metrics** for capacity planning

## Design Principles

**Event-Driven Architecture**: Each processing stage triggers downstream actions through well-defined interfaces, enabling loose coupling and error isolation.

**Scalability by Design**: SLURM cluster auto-scaling combined with serverless Lambda functions handles variable workloads from single samples to outbreak investigations.

**Data Integrity First**: Multi-step validation ensures no results are considered complete until all quality checks pass, critical for surveillance accuracy.

**Operational Readiness**: Comprehensive monitoring, automated deployments, and clear error handling prepare the system for 24/7 production operation.

## Technical Benefits

- **Reduced Processing Time**: Parallel execution and optimized resource allocation
- **Improved Reliability**: Fault tolerance and comprehensive validation mechanisms  
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and automated deployments
- **Surveillance Optimized**: Fast turnaround for outbreak response and trend analysis
- **Cost Effective**: Pay-per-use serverless components and efficient resource utilization

## Deployment Considerations

The architecture supports both development and production environments through configurable Nextflow profiles, enabling testing with reduced datasets while maintaining identical processing logic for full-scale deployment.
