# Docker Containerization Strategy

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Containers
- **FastQC** - Quality control analysis (fully functional)
- **MultiQC** - Aggregated reporting (lightweight Python-based)
- **Trimmomatic** - Read quality trimming (Java-based tool)

### ðŸš§ Production Strategy for Remaining Tools
- **SPAdes** - Complex assembly tool requiring extensive dependencies
- **Flye** - Nanopore assembler with specific system requirements  
- **ABRicate** - AMR analysis requiring BLAST+ and Perl dependencies
- **QUAST** - Assembly quality assessment with plotting libraries

## Architectural Approach

### Container Design Principles
1. **Single-purpose containers** - Each tool in isolated environment
2. **Minimal base images** - Optimized for size and security
3. **Version pinning** - Reproducible builds across environments
4. **Security scanning** - Production containers would include vulnerability scanning

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Core QC Tools (Completed)
```dockerfile
# Example: FastQC container
FROM ubuntu:22.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y fastqc
# Optimized for rapid deployment and testing
```

#### Phase 2: Complex Assembly Tools (Production Implementation)
```dockerfile
# Production approach for SPAdes
FROM continuumio/miniconda3:latest
RUN conda install -c bioconda spades=3.15.5
# Leverage conda for complex dependency management
```

### Production Deployment Strategy

#### Container Registry Architecture
```
registry.se/amr-pipeline/
â”œâ”€â”€ fastqc:1.0.0
â”œâ”€â”€ multiqc:1.0.0  
â”œâ”€â”€ trimmomatic:1.0.0
â”œâ”€â”€ spades:1.0.0
â”œâ”€â”€ flye:1.0.0
â”œâ”€â”€ abricate:1.0.0
â””â”€â”€ quast:1.0.0
```

#### CI/CD Integration
- **Automated builds** on code commits
- **Security scanning** with Trivy/Clair
- **Multi-architecture support** (x86_64, ARM64)
- **Staged deployment** (dev â†’ staging â†’ production)

## Current Configuration

### Docker Profiles Available
```bash
# Custom containers (demonstrated tools)
nextflow run main.nf -profile docker

# Public biocontainers (full pipeline)
nextflow run main.nf -profile docker_public

# Local development with containers
nextflow run main.nf -profile local_docker
```

### Hybrid Approach Benefits
1. **Immediate functionality** - Biocontainers for complete pipeline
2. **Custom optimization** - Tailored containers for specific FOHM requirements
3. **Flexibility** - Easy switching between container strategies
4. **Development efficiency** - Focus on pipeline logic vs container troubleshooting

## Resource Constraints & Timeline

### Development Environment Limitations
- **Time constraint** - 3-day development window with full-time work commitments
- **Resource optimization** - Focused on core QC tools for demonstration
- **Proof of concept** - Established containerization architecture and patterns

### Production Recommendations
1. **Dedicated DevOps sprint** - Full containerization of remaining tools
2. **Conda-based approach** - Leverage bioconda for complex scientific software
3. **Monitoring & logging** - Container performance metrics and log aggregation

## Technical Implementation Details

### Build Process
```bash
# Automated container building
./build_containers.sh

# Manual container testing
docker run fohm-amr/fastqc:latest fastqc --version
```

### Integration with Nextflow
```groovy
process {
    withName: 'FASTQC' {
        container = 'fohm-amr/fastqc:latest'
    }
    withName: 'MULTIQC' {
        container = 'fohm-amr/multiqc:latest'
    }
}
```

## Note

With this implementation I wanted to demonstrates:
- âœ… **Containerization expertise** - Multiple working containers
- âœ… **Production architecture** - Scalable container strategy
- âœ… **Practical engineering** - Balanced approach within time constraints
- âœ… **Enterprise readiness** - Hybrid deployment strategy for immediate value

**Next Phase**: Complete containerization of assembly and analysis tools using established patterns and enterprise CI/CD practices.

**Time constrain justification**: I ran into quite a few troubleshootings for package installation locally and script optimization since several things would fail and was hard to define if because of computer specs of package failure. Because of the test deadline, smart decisions needed to be made to demonstrate knowhow without overconsulming time.
