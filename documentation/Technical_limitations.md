# Technical Limitations and Solutions

## Overview
This document describes technical constraints encountered during pipeline development and the robust solutions implemented to handle them gracefully.

## Memory Constraints with Flye Assembly

### Issue Description
**Problem**: Flye assembly fails on development hardware due to memory limitations.

**Technical Details**:
- Development system: 16GB RAM laptop
- Nanopore dataset: ~120GB (original) / ~30GB (25% subset)
- Flye memory requirement: 2-4x input data size = 60-120GB RAM needed
- **Error**: `ERROR: Looks like the system ran out of memory`

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Large dataset size**: Even 25% subset requires more memory than available
2. **Flye algorithm**: Memory-intensive overlap detection and graph construction
3. **Hardware limitation**: Development on laptop vs production HPC environment

#### Resource Optimization
- **Sequential processing**: SPAdes completes before Flye starts
- **Memory limits**: Restricted to 4GB max allocation
- **Minimal parameters**: Single thread, small genome size estimation

#### Robust Architecture
- **Input validation**: Check file sizes before processing
- **Empty file detection**: Filter out failed assemblies automatically
- **Error logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging
- **Pipeline continuation**: Downstream processes work with available data

## Production Deployment Recommendations

### For Flye Success in Production
1. **Minimum hardware**: 64GB RAM system
2. **Optimal hardware**: 128GB+ RAM for large datasets
3. **Alternative approaches**:
   - Use HPC clusters with adequate memory
   - Implement data partitioning for very large files
   - Consider alternative long-read assemblers (Canu)

### Memory Requirements by Tool
| Tool | Memory Need | Status |
|------|-------------|---------|
| FastQC | 2GB | ‚úÖ Working |
| Trimmomatic | 4GB | ‚úÖ Working |
| SPAdes | 6GB | ‚úÖ Working |
| Flye | 60-120GB | ‚ùå Exceeds available |
| ABRicate | 4GB | ‚úÖ Working |

## Impact Assessment
